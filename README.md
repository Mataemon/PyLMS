An update of original pylms lib.
It brings new features like:
<ul>
<li>Notification server: It allows you to have callback when player send a message (play, pause, playing next track...)</li>
<li>Cover management: Download covers precaching them to have quick access in your UI</li>
<li>Library management: Get albums, artists, genres, years. Get artist albums, album songs...</li>
<li>Add python music player: It allows you to play music (using gstreamer)</li>
</ul>

Unfortunately some works remain to do:
<ul>
<li>Music player: for now only supports mp3 playback</li>
<li>Search function needs to be implemented in pylmslibrary.py file</li>
<li>Every functions are not yet tested!</li>
</ul>
